{"question": "How do character opinions and relationships function in Crusader Kings III according to the game's underlying scripts?", "answer": "Based on the script excerpts, characters in Crusader Kings III have opinions of each other, which can be positive or negative. These opinions are crucial because they affect various interactions, including whether characters will join plots, accept alliances, or even rebel. The script shows specific reasons for opinion changes related to participating in activities like Hunting (receiving gifts like an 'eyas' or 'trophy' increases opinion, while being a 'bad hunter', 'snubbing the leader', or 'releasing poachers' decreases it). Opinions can also change due to other factors such as having a 'licentious' or 'saucy' reputation (affecting 'attraction_opinion' positively but 'courtier_opinion' or 'county_opinion' negatively), actions like exercising 'harsh justice' or 'arbitrary justice' (affecting characters in a county), or council tasks (like a Chancellor 'Bestowing Royal Favor' increasing a vassal's opinion or failed tasks decreasing opinions of powerful vassals or neighbors). These opinion changes are usually temporary ('decaying = yes') and wear off over time, lasting for a set number of years ('years = 5', 'years = 7') or decaying slowly each month ('monthly_change = 0.05'). Furthermore, high mutual positive opinion can lead to characters becoming 'Best Friends' or 'Soulmates', while high mutual negative opinion can create 'Nemesis' relationships."}
