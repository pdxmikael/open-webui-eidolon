{"question": "How do character opinions and relationships function in Crusader Kings III according to the game's underlying scripts?", "answer": "Based on the script excerpts, characters in Crusader Kings III have opinions of each other, which can be positive or negative. These opinions are crucial because they affect various interactions, including whether characters will join plots, accept alliances, or even rebel. The script shows specific reasons for opinion changes related to participating in activities like Hunting (receiving gifts like an 'eyas' or 'trophy' increases opinion, while being a 'bad hunter', 'snubbing the leader', or 'releasing poachers' decreases it). Opinions can also change due to other factors such as having a 'licentious' or 'saucy' reputation (affecting 'attraction_opinion' positively but 'courtier_opinion' or 'county_opinion' negatively), actions like exercising 'harsh justice' or 'arbitrary justice' (affecting characters in a county), or council tasks (like a Chancellor 'Bestowing Royal Favor' increasing a vassal's opinion or failed tasks decreasing opinions of powerful vassals or neighbors). These opinion changes are usually temporary ('decaying = yes') and wear off over time, lasting for a set number of years ('years = 5', 'years = 7') or decaying slowly each month ('monthly_change = 0.05'). Furthermore, high mutual positive opinion can lead to characters becoming 'Best Friends' or 'Soulmates', while high mutual negative opinion can create 'Nemesis' relationships."}
{"question": "How do Dynasty Legacies work and what kind of benefits do they provide?", "answer": "Dynasty Legacies are pursued through different Legacy Tracks, such as the guile, erudition, law, or administrative tracks. Investing in these tracks over generations provides permanent benefits to all dynasty members. These benefits are listed as character modifiers and can include improved skills, dread gain, opinion boosts, reduced building costs, increased domain limit, and better vassal contributions."}
{"question": "What kinds of visual assets are defined for characters and how do they vary?", "answer": "The visual assets defined for characters include clothing items, headgear (like crowns, hats, religious coverings), and hair/baldness styles. These pieces are designed to fit characters and vary based on their culture, rank/type, and gender. Some character clothing and accessories can also adapt based on a character's build or age, or have multiple patterns or variations applied. Owned artifacts might also have specific 3D models displayed."}
{"question": "How does the game inform me why certain decisions or event options are available or unavailable?", "answer": "The game provides tooltip text to explain the conditions. If a decision or option has a condition (a \"trigger\") that you don't meet, a tooltip will explain the reason, for example, stating \"Requires [building name]\", \"You do not have enough provisions,\" or \"The settlement is currently sieged.\" Tooltips are also used to provide text for conditions that you *do* meet, such as being within diplomatic range for Landless Adventurer interactions."}
{"question": "How does Crusader Kings III communicate the outcome of schemes or significant events to the player?", "answer": "The game utilizes specific windows and notifications to show results. A dedicated window called `scheme_conclusion_window` or `scheme_target_event` appears to inform you of the result of schemes you participated in. For major events, the game uses full-screen character events that display titles, detailed descriptions (which can vary), character portraits, animations, and relevant backgrounds, such as presenting the outcomes after winning a war. Additionally, small popup windows (`jomini_message`) deliver important messages like a character's controller changing. Scheme details, like for seduction attempts, include descriptive text to explain the specific outcome, noting nuances like rejection even if the attempt was technically a 'success'. The game also frequently sends small, non-intrusive notifications (`send_interface_toast`) that appear briefly on the side of the screen, using visual cues like green or red effects and icons to give quick feedback on recent events or actions."}
{"question": "What are the different components the game uses to create the visual appearance of characters and objects?", "answer": "The game builds character appearances and game world visuals using a combination of layered \"decal\" entries, \"pdxmesh\" and \"entity\" sections defining 3D models, and \"pattern_textures\". Decals describe how fine details are layered onto parts of a character's body using image files and can change based on age or settings, blending together in a specific order. 3D models define actual 3D objects like headgear, hair, environmental pieces, and character parts, using specific image files for color, surface texture, and visual properties. Pattern textures define reusable designs or styles, containing different image files that allow them to be applied to other visual assets with specific colors, textures, and surface qualities."}
{"question": "Why do buildings on the map sometimes look less detailed when I'm zoomed out?", "answer": "This is due to `lod_percentages`, which represents \"Level of Detail.\" It means the game uses simpler, less detailed versions of the model when you are zoomed further away from it, and switches to the full detail version when you zoom closer. This helps the game run more smoothly."}
{"question": "How does the game determine what clothing and hairstyles characters wear in Crusader Kings III?", "answer": "The game automatically determines which visual items, including clothes, headwear, hairstyles, and legwear, a character should wear by using categories. These categories are based on the character's gender, the type of item (like headgear or clothing), their status, culture, or region, and whether the item is secular or religious."}
{"question": "How might a ruler paying tribute to you cease being your tributary?", "answer": "You might lose a ruler who was paying tribute to you if they decide to switch allegiance to another overlord."}
{"question": "What determines the visual appearance of characters' clothing, headwear, and the Royal Court environment?", "answer": "The visual appearance is determined by defined 3D models (pdxmesh) and their rendering properties like shaders and textures. These definitions cover clothing items such as headgear, cloaks, and general clothes, which are categorized by gender, type, cultural style (like sub-saharan or western royalty), and social status (such as royalty or nobility). The game uses these definitions to attach the correct clothing and headgear models to character portraits, making them appear to wear these items. Special items like artifacts have unique graphical representations defined this way, making them visually distinct. Some clothing items are designed to visually adjust based on character traits like body type. Elements of the 3D Royal Court environment are also defined using different shaders and models, contributing to its visual appearance. Different game expansions or flavor packs can add new sets of these visual assets, increasing the variety of clothing, headgear, and court appearances."}
{"question": "How does the game determine the visual appearance of special buildings, artifacts, and Royal Court elements?", "answer": "The game uses script files that define these assets visually. These files specify the 3D model (.mesh) to use and the textures (.dds images) that are wrapped onto the model to provide color, detail, and surface properties. They also include rendering settings such as the object's scale and Level of Detail versions, which dictate what these unique assets look like when seen on the map, in the Royal Court, or in inventories."}
{"question": "How does a character's appearance in Crusader Kings III visually adapt to their traits, health, or clothing?", "answer": "The game uses a system where base 3D models for elements like hair or clothing are modified by pre-made adjustments called \"blend shapes\". These blend shapes are linked to specific in-game states or characteristics through attributes. For example, a blend shape might be linked to having the 'fat' trait, wearing a specific headwear like a 'crown' or 'helmet', or states like 'pregnant' or having a 'disease'. When a character is in one of these states, the game dynamically applies the corresponding blend shape to the base model. This causes the character's portrait to visually change, such as clothing and body appearing heavier for a fat character, hair adjusting to fit under headwear, or clothing reflecting pregnancy or sickness, making the portrait reflect their current status and attire."}
{"question": "How does Crusader Kings III visually indicate that a war is going badly for my side?", "answer": "In the War Overview window, if your side's war score drops below 25%, visual elements like blood splatters or torn cloth might appear, serving as a clear, thematic indicator that the war is going poorly for you."}
{"question": "What happens to my character and realm if I assimilate to a Mandala overlord?", "answer": "If your faith is different from your overlord's, your character's faith automatically changes to match theirs. You will adopt the \"Mandala\" government or cultural system. If you are a Tribal ruler, all your landholdings will transform; if you are not Tribal, only your capital holding will change into a \"Temple Citadel\". A separate event related to successful assimilation and your piety might occur later if your overlord remains Mandala and specific criteria are met."}
{"question": "What determines if a specific event can occur for my character?", "answer": "For an event to occur, it must meet specific conditions. Your character might need to be an adult, landed, not at war, not imprisoned, or not currently sick. Travel events specifically require you to be in a valid location for travel events on land. Some events also require certain DLCs to be enabled. The game also checks relationships and status relative to other characters or your liege, such as your opinion of them (e.g., needing -50 or less), whether you possess specific traits (like Loyal or Disloyal), if your culture values disloyalty, or if you have specific vassals under you that you do not have a hook on. Additionally, many events have cooldowns, preventing them from happening again for a set duration, which can range from 6 months for some travel events to 50 years for major liege-vassal events."}
{"question": "According to the explanation, how is fertility represented and what affects it for characters and counties?", "answer": "Fertility is a key stat for characters that influences their ability to conceive children and is represented as a percentage. Modifiers, such as `amazing_fertility_counsel` (+0.5), `great_fertility_counsel` (+0.3), and `bad_fertility_counsel` (-0.1) (which seem linked to 'counsel'), or potentially from the 'Experimental Brew', add directly to this value. Counties also possess fertility values, which are influenced by terrain types like `drylands`, `forest`, `taiga`, and `wetlands`, and this county fertility impacts their `growth` and `decline` rates."}
{"question": "According to the provided text, what effects can cultural traditions have on characters belonging to that culture?", "answer": "Cultural traditions can grant special bonuses and unlock unique buildings, military units, decisions, or interactions for characters of that culture."}
{"question": "What kinds of events can occur related to characters holding Court Positions?", "answer": "The game generates events related to characters in your court, especially those holding specific Court Positions like a Food Taster. These events can be general flavor or have significant impacts, including potentially saving you from danger, as referenced by 'SAVED BY FOOD TASTER' under 'MURDER SAVE EVENTS'."}
{"question": "How does the game visually display items and equipment on characters and in the court?", "answer": "Scripts define the specific 3D models and textures used to make various items appear visually equipped on characters in portraits or within the court scene. These scripts are the blueprints for how objects and clothing characters wear, carry, or have in their surroundings are graphically rendered, making them visible to the player. Examples include bows, shields, headgear, tapestries, statues, a wooden leg, and pouches. What appears is determined by things the character possesses, like artifacts, or their traits and status, which influence default clothing and equipment."}
{"question": "What basic details about a historical character are determined by the game's historical scripts?", "answer": "The scripts define a unique ID for each character, their name, gender, dynasty, religion, and culture. They also specify their birth and death dates, their father and mother, and any spouses. Additionally, changes to attributes like religion, culture, name, or stewardship at specific points in their life can be defined."}
{"question": "What happens if a character working on an Inspiration requires more funding?", "answer": "During the course of an inspiration, the character working on it might ask for more funds. A request for additional money, for example, for an armor inspiration might explain the need for materials. You, as the player, are then presented with a choice to provide the extra money or refuse the request."}
{"question": "What determines the visual appearance of my Royal Court?", "answer": "The visual appearance of the Royal Court's 3D environment, including elements like walls, pillars, floors, and decorations, is determined by behind-the-scenes instructions. These instructions specify which textures and materials are applied to different parts of the court's models. The appearance is culturally distinct, with different cultural styles having their own textures and appearances for architectural elements. There are also variations within the same style, where specific pieces can use different textures, potentially representing different visual grades or states. Specific decorations like trophies and plaques are also included in this system using unique textures. The scripts tell the game engine how to visually dress up the court based on culture and potentially other factors."}
{"question": "What aspects of the game world at a specific start date are determined by the historical setup scripts?", "answer": "These scripts define who rules specific geographical areas and titles using `holder` entries, including political hierarchy via `liege`. They set the starting `government` type for rulers, such as nomad, tribal, or feudal. They establish the geography and political borders, showing how the map is organized into different sized areas using prefixes like `c_` and `d_`, define capitals, link land units to map locations with `province`, and determine map colors. They can also specify local names for places based on the ruler's culture using `cultural_names`. Additionally, they set the initial `development_level` for locations, impacting their starting prosperity. This information collectively builds the starting map and political situation for different historical bookmark dates."}
{"question": "Based on the description, how do interactive UI elements like buttons and checkboxes in Crusader Kings III windows work, including different click types and visual feedback?", "answer": "Interactive controls you will see include checkboxes and buttons. These controls change how they look based on their state, such as a checkbox being checked or unchecked, or a button/checkbox changing appearance when hovered over, pressed down, or if disabled. Some elements, like icons, might only appear under certain conditions. Clicking (usually left-clicking) on a checkbox or button performs an action like toggling a state, selecting an item, or opening another window. Some actions have different behaviors depending on modifier keys; for instance, a default click might isolate something exclusively, while Shift-clicking might isolate it incrementally. Right-clicking can also trigger a different action, such as toggling an exclusive lock instead of a regular one. Elements can be organized using structures and properties for layout, and sections can be collapsed or expanded by clicking an icon, hiding or showing their contents. Tooltips appear when you hover over some controls, providing a short text explanation of what the control does. Reusable styles mean many buttons or checkboxes across different windows will look and behave similarly."}
{"question": "Why does the religion or the main building type in a province sometimes change automatically as I play?", "answer": "The initial setup for provinces includes sections marked with specific dates. These dates represent points in the game's timeline when automatic, pre-defined changes, such as alterations to the province's religion or the type of its major holding, are scripted to occur."}
{"question": "What are the potential outcomes and effects of participating in a Hunt activity?", "answer": "Participating in a Hunt activity, such as a \"Nerge\", can yield various rewards depending on the outcome, including Legitimacy, Gold, Dread, Prestige, potential increases in Martial skill or commander traits, and experience points for the `lifestyle_hunter` trait. Hunts involve various events and interactions that generate specific opinions between participants. Actions and outcomes during the hunt can positively or negatively affect opinions, which are often temporary and decay over time. Different outcomes of the hunt can be classified as successful or failed."}
{"question": "What happens when my character discovers their lover is having an affair?", "answer": "If your character discovers a \"secret_lover\" secret about their lover, they might become a \"confronting_partner\". The game checks if they already knew about the affair. It identifies the two individuals involved: your lover, referred to as \"infidelity_partner\", and their lover, referred to as \"infidelity_partners_lover\". If your lover is involved in multiple affairs, the game will select one specific affair for the confrontation, potentially giving priority if the other person is a soulmate, consort, or another regular lover. The game can track who originally exposed the secret. A specific event, \"infidelity_confrontation.1000\", will then trigger for your character, representing the confrontation and likely offering choices on how to react. The game notes that this confrontation is occurring and ensures other potential confrontations related to this particular secret don't trigger simultaneously for the same character. Once all scheduled confrontations stemming from this discovery sequence have concluded, the dramatic \"story\" connected to this specific secret discovery is considered finished."}
{"question": "How does my culture's development affect my options as a ruler?", "answer": "Your culture automatically discovers specific Innovations at the game's start date and additional Innovations at specific historical dates over time. Different cultures discover different Innovations, including unique ones specific to their background. Cultures also automatically join new historical Eras at certain dates, which likely gates access to discovering more advanced Innovations. As your culture discovers relevant Innovations, you gain the ability to recruit and field specific types of Men-at-Arms units and unlock new options for you, such as new buildings you can construct or new laws/succession methods you can adopt."}
{"question": "What determines which innovations my culture starts with at the beginning of a game?", "answer": "When you begin a game in 867 or 1066 playing a character from a specific culture, your culture will already know a certain set of Innovations. The specific innovations your culture starts with vary depending on which culture you choose."}
{"question": "How does my character's faith influence random events in the game?", "answer": "Religious beliefs are woven into random yearly events and interactions. These events reference your character's faith's terminology, your character's traits, and the state of your realm. Other characters might comment on your character's traits or the realm's situation through a religious lens, suggesting divine pleasure or punishment based on your conduct or the times. Different faiths might have unique flavor text in these events."}
{"question": "What influences a character's personal goal or focus during an activity?", "answer": "Both the Host and Guests can have an Intent, which is their personal goal or focus during the activity. Characters choose an Intent based on their traits and circumstances. For example, a character with the 'Lustful' or 'Rakish' trait is much more likely to choose the 'Lechery Intent' (presumably seeking romantic encounters), while a 'Chaste' character would not. Characters can also default to general intents like reducing stress. Intents can have requirements and influence what happens during the activity; some happen automatically."}
{"question": "What factors determine the visual appearance of a character's clothing in Crusader Kings III?", "answer": "The game sets up visual differentiation in character portraits based on factors like their culture, social standing, role, and gender. Script definitions link garment names that reflect these factors to specific visual assets like 3D models and image files."}
{"question": "Can holy sites help my Court Chaplain convert counties faster?", "answer": "Yes, when your Court Chaplain is performing the \"Convert Faith\" task in a county, their progress can be boosted by nearby holy sites. If your Chaplain's faith controls specific holy sites like Iona, Wadi el-Milk, or Cordoba, and the barony holding the holy site is recognized as a holy site for their faith, they receive bonus values that are added up to increase the conversion speed."}
{"question": "What information can I find on the screen used for loading saved games?", "answer": "The screen titled \"LOAD GAME\" presents a list of your saved games. For each game, there is a button to load it. This load button might be disabled if required DLCs are missing, and hovering over a disabled button will show a tooltip listing the missing DLCs. The screen includes a scrollbar to view all saves and an option labeled something like \"Show Invalid Savegames\" to toggle viewing saves with potential issues. There is also a button to go back from this screen."}
{"question": "What causes a character's appearance in their portrait to change dynamically?", "answer": "A character's portrait appearance dynamically changes based on their gear and physical characteristics. Headwear such as crowns, helmets, hats, caps, or hoods will cause the character's hair and sometimes beard to automatically adjust their shape to fit correctly underneath, preventing visual issues like clipping. Additionally, the character's body shape, including traits like being fat, gaunt, muscular, or a dwarf, and conditions such as being an infant, old, or potentially diseased, affect how their clothing, cloaks, hair, and headgear fit and look, ensuring these items naturally conform to the character's build and current state. For female characters, even breast size can influence how hair sits."}
{"question": "What factors influence how much I have to pay for a character holding a court position?", "answer": "The cost of employing courtiers is dynamic and depends on several factors, including whether the position is considered \"inner circle,\" specific \"obligation hooks\" tied to the position, recent events like having \"found\" a specific character, whether the character has certain discount flags, your government type (Tribal governments might pay less), your culture having traditions that make court positions cheaper, your highest held title tier (higher tiers might increase salaries), and external factors potentially related to systems like Chinese Imperial interactions."}
{"question": "How does acquiring specific items or clothing affect my character's appearance in the game?", "answer": "When your character obtains certain items like headgear, clothing, or artifacts such as swords and shields, these items can appear visually on their 2D portrait. Some larger artifacts, particularly shields, can also be displayed in the 3D Royal Court environment if you have access to it. For items like shields, your character's Coat of Arms is applied directly onto the item's surface, both on the portrait and in the court scene. This makes characters look more unique, reflects their possessions, and provides varied visual appearances based on the type of item."}
{"question": "What kinds of events and experiences can a character have while imprisoned?", "answer": "When a character is imprisoned, they can experience unique events that feature a distinct prison visual theme and sound effects. During these events, your character's portrait will display beggar rags, and their animation might change depending on their personality traits, such as showing boredom if Callous or Sadistic, or stress if they lack those traits. You will be presented with choices in these events. One potential outcome is your character getting beaten, resulting in a negative notification featuring the imprisoner's portrait, gaining wounds, and potentially gaining stress, particularly if your character is Craven. The likelihood of this outcome can be influenced by skill differences like Diplomacy. Some choices in these events may only be available if your character possesses certain traits, like Callous or Sadistic, allowing you to roleplay those traits. For very long imprisonments, specifically after over 5 years, rare events can occur, such as one involving a dying prison pet, which causes your character to show a grief animation, uses the prison theme, and cannot trigger more than once a year."}
{"question": "As a Nomadic ruler, what actions can I take if my culture is different from the culture of the land I inhabit?", "answer": "If you are a Nomadic ruler and your culture differs from your \"domicile culture\" (the culture of the land you primarily inhabit), you have specific decisions available. One decision is to \"Enforce Traditions,\" which likely reinforces your own culture over the local one. Another decision is to \"Adopt Domicile Culture,\" allowing your character and dynasty to switch to the culture of the place they live."}
{"question": "How does the AI determine which action or option it will select?", "answer": "The AI uses a system based on likelihood or weighted chance. It calculates a score or weight for each valid choice. This score is influenced by factors including a base value, character traits, relationships and opinions, their current situation, and sometimes AI-specific values. The AI then picks one of the choices based on these calculated weights, where a higher weight means a higher chance. For some actions, there's also an initial check to see if the AI will even consider the action based on major conditions."}
{"question": "How does the game determine who might receive an artifact as a gift during an activity?", "answer": "The game selects a potential recipient from the characters attending the activity. It specifically looks for adult characters who are not landed rulers, not your very close family (spouse, consort, friends, lovers, soulmates), and not you or a specific \"stop host\" character. It favors selecting attendees who have high skills. Once a recipient is chosen, the game then searches your character's inventory for artifacts that are not currently equipped and might select one of these to be given away."}
{"question": "What specific activity involving old books is mentioned as a way for my character to engage with and preserve historical knowledge?", "answer": "One specific event or activity involves attempting to translate a classic historical work. This task, potentially involving famous treatises, religious texts, historical accounts, or philosophical works like Euclid's *Elements*, Aristotle's *Physica*, the Persian *Shahnameh*, or Norse Sagas, is described as a way for your character to directly engage with and preserve historical knowledge."}
{"question": "Why do numbers sometimes appear with a 'º' symbol after them when playing the game in Spanish?", "answer": "When the game is played in Spanish, numbers representing a position in a list, rank, or sequence (ordinal numbers) are displayed with the number followed by the 'º' symbol. This is a specific localization setting for the Spanish language version that defines this visual formatting rule for numbers."}
{"question": "What determines the appearance of specific clothing items, accessories, and artifacts on characters or in scenes like the Royal Court?", "answer": "Script files in the game act as the underlying definitions for these visual items. They specify the 3D shape, textures, and how the game's rendering system should draw objects such as different types of headgear, handheld or tabletop items, and larger decorative items. These scripts define how the items look and are designed as attachments to be added to character models or placed in scenes where characters are displayed, allowing players to see characters wearing specific hats, displaying unique artifacts, or having certain objects present in their Royal Court."}
{"question": "How are taxes and levies distributed from land holdings that have been leased out to another character?", "answer": "When a holding is leased out, the money (taxes) and military strength (levies) it generates are not automatically yours. The split of taxes can be detailed, potentially going to a \"lease liege\" first, with the rest being split between you (the ruler) and the lessee based on defined rules, although the default is the lessee gets everything. Levies are simpler; they can only go entirely to you or entirely to the lessee, not split partly to both. Your opinion with the lessee or having a hook on them might influence whether you receive benefits from the leased titles."}
{"question": "Do these script files affect the visual appearance of the Royal Court, and can that appearance change based on my culture?", "answer": "These files define the visuals for parts of your Royal Court room, including the floor, walls (such as the \"throne wall\"), and roofing. They show different versions for distinct cultural styles like \"Mena,\" \"Indian,\" and \"Mediterranean,\" suggesting that depending on your character's culture, your court chamber will have a unique look. They define the shapes of these elements and how they are textured to create this appearance."}
{"question": "How is a character's facial appearance determined in the game, and why do children resemble their parents?", "answer": "A character's specific facial appearance is determined by genetic data that defines specific aspects of their face, making every character's face unique. This data tracks detailed features such as the width and shape of the lower lip, the definition and shape of the philtrum, and the forward projection, height, and length of the nose. For each facial feature, a character inherits two pieces of genetic information, likely one from each parent, each with a numerical value. The combination of these two pieces determines the final look of that specific feature on the character's face. Since appearance is stored genetically this way, children born in the game inherit combinations of these specific facial feature values from their parents, leading them to visually resemble their family members."}
{"question": "How are the detailed visual appearances of characters in Crusader Kings III generated and adapted?", "answer": "Character portraits are generated using 3D models for individual visual components like beards, hair, cloaks, and headgear, which results in varied appearances based on factors like culture and social status. These models have detailed visuals achieved through textures and shaders, defining colors, surface details, and how they react to light. The visual pieces can dynamically adjust their shape using blend shapes based on character traits such as body type (fat or gaunt), age (old), or what other clothing/armor they are wearing (to fit under headgear like crowns, hats, or helmets). Some components, likely hair and beards, can also have their colors changed in-game to match a character's hair color. These individual pieces are mixed, matched, reshaped, and colored to create diverse and lifelike character appearances."}
{"question": "What are Artifacts in the game and how do they affect gameplay?", "answer": "Artifacts are special items like crowns, weapons, or unique items such as \"Water of the Jordan\". These artifacts have specific properties or states represented by \"modifiers\", like \"Crown of the People\", \"Dueling Weapon\", \"Blessed Artifact\", or \"Desecrated Relic\". These modifiers affect gameplay in some way, often giving benefits, such as granting monthly prestige as shown for a blessed artifact, or sometimes drawbacks, like the \"Holy Water, Mortal Stomach\" modifier suggests for the \"Water of the Jordan\", implying a negative effect or \"lurgy\" from consumption."}
{"question": "How does the game handle different physical traits and headgear to make character portraits look correct?", "answer": "The game automatically adjusts the appearance of character portraits. When characters wear specific headgear such as a crown, hat, cap, helmet, or hood, their hair or beard will automatically change shape slightly to fit underneath. If a character has certain physical traits like being fat, gaunt, muscular, old, an infant, or a dwarf, their clothing, hair, and headgear will adapt to match their body shape or size. This system ensures the 3D portrait appears consistent and realistic, with different clothing and physical features seamlessly integrated."}
{"question": "How does the game make visual items like clothing or statues look different from each other, even if they share the same basic shape?", "answer": "The game uses a basic 3D shape for an item, called a `pdxmesh`. To make the same basic shape look different, the item's definition includes a `variation` which specifies how the item should be styled, such as appearing as different materials or having different colors. A `pattern_mask` helps apply this styling from the `variation` to specific parts of the basic shape. This system allows the same underlying model to appear visually distinct, reflecting different styles, materials, or qualities."}
{"question": "Does the game automatically simulate historical changes over time after I start playing?", "answer": "The game world isn't static; the script lists specific historical dates where changes occur automatically. On these dates, titles automatically change hands with a new `holder`, overlords can shift indicated by the `liege` line making rulers vassals to new entities or independent, development levels of provinces evolve set by `change_development_level` impacting income and levies, and occasionally government types change via the `government` setting. These dated entries trigger automatically as you play through the timeline, unless your actions as a player override them for affected titles."}
{"question": "How does the game visually represent the artifacts and items my character possesses or wears?", "answer": "The game uses 3D models for certain artifacts and character appearance items. You will see many items, such as weapons, regalia, clothing, and headgear, displayed attached to your character's 3D portrait; some items, like shields, can even show your character's Coat of Arms. Other artifacts, like large icons, are represented as physical objects placed within your Royal Court scene. These visible items are detailed using specific 3D shapes, surface textures for color and detail, and rendering techniques. Some models can even adjust slightly to fit different character body shapes. This process translates owned items into the visible experience on portraits and in the court."}
{"question": "What fundamental characteristics, abilities, and life events are tracked for an individual character?", "answer": "Characters have fundamental characteristics: a unique name, gender (male by default, female if specified), religion, culture, and a dynasty or house affiliation. Their family ties are recorded through a father and mother. Their capabilities are defined by attributes/skills like martial, diplomacy, intrigue, and stewardship, representing ability in areas such as leading armies, managing vassals, plotting, or running their domain, and by traits which provide specific bonuses, penalties, or interaction options, often linked to education or life experiences. Significant life events recorded with specific dates include their birth, death, and marriage to another character (identified by ID)."}
{"question": "How does the game adjust the text I see, like names and descriptions, based on my character and the situation?", "answer": "The game uses a system that dynamically chooses text to display based on various conditions. This means different names or terms are picked depending on religion (like \"Blót\" vs. \"Festival\"), gender (like \"Shieldmaiden/Shieldman\"), or location (descriptions of beings based on region). Descriptions are also contextual, changing based on culture (for \"Hold Court\" text) or event variables (specifying \"military,\" \"civil,\" or \"religious\" parades). For events, the text on option buttons can change based on your character's traits (like Compassionate or Cannibal) or existing conditions, and the main event description can adapt based on things that happened earlier (like mentioning blaming a \"witch\"). Events can also show character portraits with specific animations (stress, shock) and some events have cooldowns, preventing them from happening again for a period. This dynamic text system makes the game feel tailored to the specific character, culture, religion, location, and situation."}
{"question": "What factors determine the type of secular headwear a male character wears in their portrait?", "answer": "Male characters in their portraits wear headwear. The specific kind they display is determined by their cultural background and their social rank or status. For instance, a character's headwear could differ depending on if they are from a Steppe, Middle Eastern/North African, Holy Roman Empire, Mongol, or Abbasid culture, and whether they hold the status of a Commoner, Noble, Royal, or Imperial. Some headwear may also visually adapt slightly based on the character's physical attributes, like body shape, and particularly significant pieces might have a separate visual representation for artifacts or court scenes."}
{"question": "When I am modifying a contract with a subject in the game, what specific obligation changes can I preview?", "answer": "When modifying a contract in the `ModifySubjectContractInteractionWindow`, you can preview the breakdown of how the proposed changes will affect the subject's contributions for Levies, Piety, Prestige, and Herd. The window uses labels such as \"To Me,\" \"To My Overlord,\" \"To My Liege,\" or \"To My Suzerain\" to indicate these contributions."}
{"question": "What are the requirements for creating or promoting a Legend in Crusader Kings III?", "answer": "To start a brand new Legend about your character or dynasty, you must be at least 12 years old. To help spread an existing Legend, you must be an adult (age 12 or older) and hold at least one landed title. Additionally, you need some connection to the Legend or its main figure. This could be being part of the same dynasty as the Legend's owner, sharing a language with them, having a friendly relationship with them, or if the Legend has already spread to a county neighboring one you hold. The game will show you a tooltip explaining why you cannot promote a specific Legend if you don't meet these connection requirements."}
{"question": "How does the game determine the specific textures and designs applied to different parts of a character's clothing or headgear?", "answer": "The specific textures and designs applied to different parts of a character's clothing or headgear are determined by a system that links items like robes or hats to 'variations'. Each variation contains one or more 'patterns', which act as recipes specifying the textures and layouts to be used. A 'pattern_mask' divides the item's 3D model into multiple distinct areas. The pattern then tells the game which texture, such as different types of silk, leather, brocades, or trims, goes onto which specific area defined by the mask. If a variation has multiple patterns, the game can select one, allowing the same type of item to appear with different texture combinations."}
{"question": "Where do Modifiers appear and what do they look like?", "answer": "They appear as icons and text on a character's profile, indicating specific states, experiences, or advantages/disadvantages they currently have."}
{"question": "What are the expected mechanics or characteristics of a ruler with the Celestial Government type in Crusader Kings III?", "answer": "The Celestial Government is a specific governmental system used by rulers associated with the \"Celestial\" concept. While not fully detailed, rulers under this system are expected to interact with mechanics related to administration, merit-based systems, a \"mandate\" system, managing a treasury, and specific rules for their generals. This government type is different from standard feudal or tribal systems, likely focusing on administrative efficiency, earning positions through merit, and potentially having a unique system of legitimacy (the \"mandate\")."}
{"question": "How can I respond if another character attempts to seduce me, and what are the potential outcomes?", "answer": "When another character attempts to seduce you, you will likely be given response options. You can refuse generically, which may worsen the seducer's opinion of you and cause stress if your character has the Lustful trait. You can also refuse specifically due to religious or moral objections like adultery, which may gain you Piety but could cause significant stress, especially if you are Lustful or Cynical, while still likely disappointing the seducer and worsening their opinion. If your character is Lustful and attracted to the seducer's gender, you might have the option to accept the attempt. Accepting leads to the characters having sex, with a chance of pregnancy. If your relationship allows, you might also become Lovers, and the seducer will likely gain a better opinion of you. However, if the act constitutes adultery, your character might gain stress, particularly if Zealous, and a Secret might be created."}
{"question": "When planning a 'Hike' activity, what key decisions do I make and how do those choices impact the outcome or experience?", "answer": "Initiating a Hike involves choosing a Destination, the Travel Length (Short or Long), and an Intent (Befriend or Mystic). You also have the option to invite a Traveling Companion.\n\nChoosing more remote terrain for your Destination increases the Prestige and Stress loss you gain.\n\nSelecting a 'Short Hike' results in a shorter activity with fewer 'opportunities', while a 'Long Hike' is longer with more 'opportunities'. The predicted cost is primarily affected by the chosen length.\n\nYour Intent focuses the activity: 'Befriend' concentrates on gaining Opinion with a Traveling Companion, while 'Mystic' focuses on being alone for potential experience towards certain traits.\n\nWhile inviting a Traveling Companion is optional, guests can benefit by reducing their Stress and gaining Prestige. Opportunities occur during the hike's travel and 'Roaming' phase, contributing to outcomes like Stress loss, Prestige gain, Opinion gain (with a companion/Befriend), and trait experience gain (Mystic), providing respite from ruling pressures."}
{"question": "How does the game determine the starting state of titles and land when a player begins a game?", "answer": "The game determines the historical start positions for titles and land by using script excerpts that list properties under specific dates. These dates act as checkpoints. When you choose a starting date, the game looks at this history file to determine who holds specific titles or pieces of land using the `holder` line, who their boss is using the `liege` line (with `liege = 0` indicating independence), what type of government they use using the `government` line, and the development level of a county using the `change_development_level` line, all as they are defined *at that precise moment*. These properties remain the same until the next date listed in the script for that location, setting up the world before the player starts influencing it."}
{"question": "How does a character's physical build or age affect the appearance of their clothing or headgear in the game?", "answer": "The game uses a system where clothing, headgear, and beard 3D models dynamically adjust their shape to fit the character. This is done via 'blend_shape' entries. For example, models will subtly adjust based on attributes like being fat, muscular, gaunt, old, or infant. If a character has the 'Fat' trait, their clothes will adjust to fit a larger shape. If they are 'Gaunt', the models adapt to a thinner frame. Items also change shape for characters as they age, or for those with traits like 'Dwarfism', ensuring the visual items match the character's physical form."}
{"question": "What determines how buildings look visually on the map?", "answer": "The visual appearance of buildings and structures such as cities, temples, or walls on the map is determined by two factors. As you zoom the camera closer, you see more detailed versions, while zooming further out switches to simpler versions. Additionally, the visual look or style of buildings, including the textures used, is styled to match the local culture or religion of the county, resulting in different appearances for regions like India, Western Europe, the Mediterranean, or areas corresponding to Islamic or Christian styles."}
{"question": "What effects can upgrading holdings have, particularly regarding culture, faith, and vassal reactions?", "answer": "Upgrading holdings triggers specific effects upon completion. The benefits can depend on your culture; if your culture has the `renown_from_temple_construction` tradition, your dynasty might gain prestige, and if it has the `more_fervor_on_church_construction` tradition, your faith might gain fervor. Upgrading also impacts your vassals. Vassals with a \"parochial\" personality or vassal stance will like you more due to the `parochial_approves_holding_upgrade_opinion` modifier, and a tooltip often appears explaining this approval."}
{"question": "How do characters acquire education traits upon reaching adulthood, and can a player influence which trait they receive?", "answer": "Characters typically receive one of these education traits when they grow up from childhood into adulthood. While growing up, a child is often given an Education Focus in one of the skill areas (Diplomacy, Martial, Stewardship, Intrigue, and Learning). This focus seems to guide their learning and influences which education trait they will receive and at what level."}
{"question": "How does the quality level of my Royal Court impact gameplay?", "answer": "The Quality of your Royal Court, categorized from terrible to excellent, has direct gameplay effects. It adjusts the opinion of courtiers and guests residing at your court and affects your passive dread baseline. A good court improves the opinion of people at your court and reduces your passive dread generation, while a bad court makes them unhappy and increases your passive dread."}
{"question": "What factors determine which random event occurs when I Hold Court, or if a specific event can occur at all?", "answer": "Holding Court triggers a series of random events selected from a list. The likelihood of a specific event being chosen is determined by its 'weight'; a higher weight makes it more likely. However, an event will only occur if certain 'conditions' or 'triggers' are met, such as having specific characters in court, meeting requirements like amenity levels or government type, or if certain flags are not set. Additionally, some events have a 'cooldown' period, preventing them from happening again for a set amount of time after they last occurred. Events can also be specific to certain game features or expansion content sources."}
{"question": "How does the game determine the starting technologies available to different cultures and the initial setup of counties when I begin a new game?", "answer": "The game uses historical starting condition scripts that specify the world setup for different dates. For various cultures, these scripts list the specific innovations they have discovered at a particular historical date, such as 867 AD or 1066 AD. When you start the game at a chosen date, each culture begins with the set of innovations listed for them at that time, which dictates their initial capabilities and access to things like buildings, units, and laws. Similarly, for specific counties, the scripts define their culture, religion, the main holding type (like castle, city, or church), and any specific buildings present within the main holding at that historical date. The world setup, including cultural innovations and county characteristics, is configured according to these definitions for your chosen starting year."}
{"question": "What are Holy Sites in Crusader Kings III, and what benefits do characters gain from holding them?", "answer": "Specific counties are designated as Holy Sites for certain religions or religious groups. If a character holds a county that is a Holy Site for their faith, they receive special Character Modifiers. These modifiers grant various benefits; for example, holding Damascus provides increased levy size and faster county control growth in that county, holding Siffa increases Prowess and Knight Effectiveness, holding Kufa increases Intrigue based on Piety, holding Beirut improves opinions with council members, holding Baghdad improves development growth and reduces church holding building costs, and holding Kerala grants a large bonus to converting the county's religion."}
{"question": "Why do buildings, walls, and other structures look different across the map?", "answer": "The visual appearance of structures like buildings, walls, cities, and bridges varies based on their cultural region and the specific type of structure. This diversity is defined by different 3D models, detailed textures such as diffuse, normal, and specular maps, and decals. The game also uses shaders like snap_to_terrain to integrate these models seamlessly with the landscape and employs level of detail (lod_percentages) to manage visual quality and performance depending on your zoom level. These elements together determine how map structures look, providing cultural variety and visual detail."}
{"question": "Why should I pay attention to my vassals' stances?", "answer": "Vassal Stances represent a vassal's core priorities and beliefs about the realm and their liege's behavior, directly influencing how they perceive your actions and decisions. The most direct impact is on their Opinion of you; doing things a vassal with a specific stance likes gains Opinion, while doing things they dislike loses Opinion. Maintaining positive Opinion is crucial for keeping vassals loyal and preventing factions or rebellions. Stances also determine a vassal's reactions during game events or decisions and can subtly influence mechanical modifiers like the amount of levies they provide. You can see a vassal's stance on their character screen and use it to understand their preferences, such as what they like, dislike, and prefer in an heir, which helps manage stability and relationships."}
{"question": "What happens if I assign my Court Chaplain the task of Conversion?", "answer": "It is a specific job you can assign to your Court Chaplain councilor. They will work on converting the population of a single county within your realm to your faith. Its progress is tracked and shown as a percentage."}
{"question": "How does the game ensure that headgear visually fits characters with different physical characteristics or ages?", "answer": "Headgear definitions include special instructions called blend shapes. These instructions tell the game how to subtly alter the shape of the headgear model, automatically adjusting its appearance to properly fit the character's physical characteristics, such as being fat, old, or a dwarf. This process ensures the headgear looks natural on their head regardless of their specific body type or age."}
{"question": "How do the game's tutorial systems guide a player?", "answer": "Tutorials utilize various methods to guide the player. They can automatically move the camera to focus on relevant map areas, such as a specific county. Instructions and descriptions are displayed as text. Specific user interface elements like buttons for raising troops or declaring war might be highlighted to show the player where to click. Progress within tutorials is tracked using flags and global variables, and a tutorial step often requires completing a specific action or reaching a certain game state to proceed; for example, a 'Next' button might only become enabled if the player is at war with a specific character or controls a particular territory. The game can also trigger a new reactive tutorial based on an action the player takes, like an opponent declaring war on them."}
{"question": "What determines how severe a plague is and what effects does its severity have?", "answer": "Plague intensity determines its severity, classified as Minor, Major, or Apocalyptic. The intensity dictates how wide an area the plague spreads over, how long it lasts, how many characters are likely to get infected, and how many people are likely to die (fatalities). An Apocalyptic plague is the most severe and has the widest impact on all these factors. Additionally, travel can be harder, especially during severe (Apocalyptic) outbreaks."}
{"question": "What are the different types of relationships defined between rulers and their subjects or tributaries?", "answer": "Relationships between a ruler and their vassals or tributaries are defined by Subject Contract Types. These include types like feudal vassal, republic vassal, clan vassal, tribal vassal, admin vassal, herder vassal, and celestial vassal for vassals. For tributaries, the types shown are tributary subjugated and tributary celestial. Each type lists specific contracts dictating obligations like tax payment or soldier provision, and for tributaries, they also specify map appearance and succession rules."}
{"question": "What aspects of gameplay can Modifiers influence?", "answer": "Modifiers represent specific situations, conditions, activities, or states and impact game mechanics. They are visible through icons with tooltips on characters, counties, or within screens. Modifiers can alter a character's core stats, health, fertility, and life expectancy, affect stress gain or loss, influence opinions between characters, change the effectiveness or duration of Schemes, impact military factors like mercenary/Men-at-Arms costs, maintenance, and effectiveness, affect economic factors like income and building costs, modify county properties such as development growth, construction speed/cost, supply capacity, control growth, local opinion, travel safety, and defensive structures, boost lifestyle experience gain, and alter Dread gain."}
{"question": "How can I acquire artifacts like furniture or crowns?", "answer": "You can use a specific player decision called the \"commission_artifact_decision\" to create items such as tapestries, furniture, crowns, and regalia. This decision is available if you own the Royal Court DLC and currently have an active Royal Court. These commissioned items belong to different categories or \"artifact_slot_type\" like \"sculpture\" or \"helmet\"."}
{"question": "Based on these file paths, are all the mechanics mentioned always available in Crusader Kings III?", "answer": "Some of the game mechanics, such as specific events, decisions (like those related to East Asia), Governor Contracts, or modifiers, are tied to paid expansions or content packs rather than being part of the base game, as indicated by references to 'dlc/tgp' or 'fp2'."}
{"question": "How does the game determine who rules which land and who their liege is when I start a new game?", "answer": "When you begin a new game, you select a historical start date. The game then uses script definitions specific to that date to create the map and characters. For each piece of land, the script specifies who holds the title and who their direct liege is (or indicates they are independent if the liege is 0). These script details, including changes that occurred on historical dates before your chosen start, establish the rulers and their relationships for the scenario you play."}
{"question": "What are Points of Interest during a journey and can journeys improve my character's skills?", "answer": "During a journey, special buildings in provinces you pass through can become Points of Interest, which can be highlighted as particularly interesting or described as Protected. When you start a journey, you choose a specific skill to focus on, and completing the journey gives you a chance to improve that skill."}
{"question": "How does the game determine the visual appearance of character clothing and create variety?", "answer": "Characters wear different clothes, and these items are associated with specific cultures, social statuses, or time periods. A piece of clothing's final look is created by combining a basic shape with specific patterns or visual styles. The same basic clothing model can be used for different characters, but its final appearance can be altered by a variation system. This variation system applies different patterns, textures, or details to the clothing, making the same underlying item look distinct depending on who is wearing it and their context, like their culture or rank. This system ensures characters wear clothes appropriate to their background and achieves visual diversity efficiently by applying different patterns and styles to basic clothing models."}
{"question": "How are the items and artifacts that my character possesses visually displayed in the game?", "answer": "Many items you interact with, especially artifacts you own, have their own visual models defined by game scripts. A key mechanic is \"portrait attachments,\" meaning many items like headgear, props such as books or swords, are designed to be visually attached to your character's portrait, showing them wearing or holding what they have equipped or owned. Some items, such as statues and potentially other artifacts like certain swords, can also have different visual representations or placements and are intended for display in your court scene. Additionally, details like a shield artifact can show your Coat of Arms."}
{"question": "How can I tell if an achievement is unlocked or locked when viewing them?", "answer": "Achievements are presented with specific backgrounds and each is shown with an icon. If an achievement is unlocked, its icon appears normal and hovering over it confirms it's \"UNLOCKED\". If an achievement is locked, its icon appears partially faded with a padlock icon overlaid on it, and hovering over it confirms it's \"LOCKED\"."}
{"question": "How does the game create the detailed patterns on character clothing and accessories?", "answer": "The game uses a system where `portrait_accessory` components, such as details on clothing or headgear, are patterned. A `pattern_mask` points to a texture file that acts like a stencil, defining *which specific parts* of the accessory model should receive a certain pattern or look. A separate `variation` definition contains the actual visual style to be applied, such as a specific fabric pattern or color combination. The system combines the template from the `pattern_mask` with the style from the `variation` to apply detailed visual elements, resulting in characters having visually distinct and detailed items with patterns and styles appropriate for factors like their culture or social status."}
{"question": "What are noble family titles like `c_nf_park_juksan` and what do they mean for a character?", "answer": "Titles defined as `landless = yes` and `noble_family = yes`, such as those related to Korean noble families, represent a special type of title. They signify status or lineage within a specific cultural group. These titles do not grant actual land or political power; they won't be chosen as a character's primary title, and they don't give automatic claims. They persist within the family and follow the primary heir."}
{"question": "How do certain cultures automatically gain new knowledge, such as specific innovations or progress into different historical eras?", "answer": "For specific cultures, the script dictates that they automatically discover additional innovations or move into different historical eras as the game's timeline reaches certain specified historical dates. This represents a scheduled historical advancement, determining what technologies, legal systems, or societal concepts, such as `innovation_quilted_armor` or `innovation_gavelkind`, they know at historical starting points or learn automatically over time, which in turn affects capabilities like building construction, soldier recruitment, or law enactment. Progression into eras like `culture_era_early_medieval` or `culture_era_high_medieval` also occurs automatically on specific dates."}
{"question": "How does Crusader Kings III define characters considered 'Criminal' or 'Scandalous'?", "answer": "Characters are defined as a \"Witch,\" \"Deviant,\" or \"Incestuous\" if they possess the corresponding character trait or a hidden \"secret\" of that type. A character is specifically known to be a witch by another character if that character is aware of the first character's witch secret."}
{"question": "How does the game determine what clothing and headgear characters wear?", "answer": "The game uses `portrait_accessory` sections in the script to define character clothing and headgear, which are visual elements attached to a character's portrait. A `pattern_mask` defines the specific areas on the clothing or headgear where patterns or details can appear, acting like a stencil. The `variation` part specifies the type of pattern or style to apply within those masked areas. These variations are identified by names that include clues about the character's culture or region, social status or role, quality or tier of attire, gender or age, and historical context or era. This system automatically ensures characters are dressed in clothing and headgear appropriate to their background, allowing you to visually distinguish different types of characters based on factors like their culture, status, and gender."}
{"question": "What is the primary impact of character relations, such as being a Lover or Rival, on other characters in Crusader Kings III?", "answer": "Relations represent special, named connections between characters, like friendships, romantic relationships, or rivalries. A key effect of these relations is that they influence one character's opinion of another. The type of relation directly affects how much someone likes or dislikes another character; for instance, a `Lover` relation gives a significant positive opinion boost. Relations also influence various events and interactions and are used in game logic to determine if certain actions or events can occur."}
{"question": "What factors determine the style of headgear and beards characters wear?", "answer": "Characters wear diverse styles of headgear and beards based on their gender, culture or region (such as steppe, Abbasid, Indian, Norse, Western, or Iberian), and their religion or social status categories like religious, secular, common, high, warrior noble, royalty, or special. Additionally, the visual shape of the headgear and beards will dynamically adjust to fit the character's specific physical traits like being fat, old, gaunt, or a dwarf."}
{"question": "How are health issues like wounds and diseases represented in the game, and what are some examples of ailments a character can suffer from?", "answer": "The game tracks character health issues, including wounds and diseases. Wounds have different levels from minor (`wounded_1`) to severe (`wounded_3`), with the most severe wound level being prioritized for display. Characters can contract various specific diseases, such as Pneumonia, Gout, Leprosy, Typhus, Consumption, Cancer, Lover's Pox, Early Great Pox, Great Pox, Smallpox, Measles, Dysentery, Ergotism, and Bubonic Plague. When a character has a specific disease or wound level, the game assigns a corresponding trait, like the 'Leper' trait or 'Wounded III' trait, which appears on their character panel. These traits and hidden flags are used to describe the character's ailment. The game can also randomly select from a list of potential diseases for a character to contract."}
{"question": "How do cultural innovations impact military capabilities?", "answer": "Cultural innovations are advancements researched or adopted by cultures that grant benefits to characters belonging to that culture. Specific military innovations provide direct bonuses. Royal Armory helps peasant levies replenish faster. Standing Armies allows recruiting and maintaining more professional soldiers. Sappers helps complete sieges quicker."}
{"question": "What types of visual elements in Crusader Kings III are defined by these script files?", "answer": "These scripts define the visual appearance of various elements you see while playing. This includes parts of the map such as trees and different types of cliffs (like coastlines or rocky terrain), buildings like castles which can vary by region (western Mediterranean, Persian), aspects of character appearance such as hairstyles and headgear (western baby hairstyle, imperial headpiece), and artifacts like crowns, statues, or religious icons, some of which can be worn on portraits (potentially with customizable patterns) or appear elsewhere like in your royal court."}
{"question": "Does the world state automatically change as the game progresses through different historical dates?", "answer": "Yes, if you play the game past any of the dates listed for a particular county, duchy, or barony, the game will automatically apply the changes defined for that date. These changes happen instantly on the specified dates. The ruler (holder), government type, vassal relationship (liege), culture, religion, development level, and holding type for specific locations might change automatically on these defined dates."}
{"question": "How can I get foreign traders to visit or establish themselves in my African counties?", "answer": "Periodic events related to foreign traders may occur for rulers whose counties are located in the Sahel or Sub-Saharan Africa immediate regions. These events require the ruler to be an adult, at peace, and not have recent trade-related modifiers or enclaves. They happen in counties where the local faith is one of a list of unreformed African religions, and which border a province in the Sahara or Sahel that has a more established, non-pagan faith. These events can result in the establishment of foreign trader enclaves in your territory."}
{"question": "What kind of benefits can I receive when my Steward successfully completes administrative tasks?", "answer": "When your character's Steward successfully completes administrative tasks related to supplies or resources, their governance effect can increase. You can also receive a significant amount of gold. Your capital province can gain a modifier called \"Greatly Equipped Soldiers\" for 15 years, and all counties you directly control can gain a modifier called \"Well Equipped Soldiers\" for 10 or 15 years in their provincial capitals."}
{"question": "How can I help a courtier who has an inspiration but no sponsor?", "answer": "You can use a specific character interaction with that courtier or guest. This interaction becomes available when they have an inspiration that does not currently have a sponsor. Using this interaction likely involves providing resources or support to help them complete their inspired project. The game highlights this interaction to draw your attention when it's available."}
{"question": "What determines the visual appearance of buildings and fortifications like castles, cities, temples, and walls on the map?", "answer": "Buildings and fortifications are represented by distinct 3D models on the map, varying by type like city, temple, castle, or walls, and by regional or cultural styles such as Mediterranean, Western, or Norse. Textures provide surface detail and color, while decals add specific elements like grime, cracks, or symbols. The game also uses different, progressively simpler versions of the models depending on the zoom level, affecting the visible detail and complexity."}
